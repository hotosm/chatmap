# ChatMap

## Field mapping has never been easier!

Export a chat (WhatsApp, Telegram or Signal) and upload it to visualize locations, messages and media.

### Try it here! [chatmap.hotosm.org](https://chatmap.hotosm.org)

Check this quick [video-tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScHgVhyj1aw) (2:47) for more info about how to use it.

## Install and run

```bash
cd chatmap-ui
yarn install
yarn start
```

Test with `yarn test`.

## ChatMap Live + linked devices

In Live mode, people can link a device to get a live stream of data and update maps in real-time,
even with locations coming from direct messages, not only groups, and without the need of manually
exporting chats.

Check [docs](https://github.com/hotosm/chatmap/blob/develop/docs/live.md) for enabling
the Live version of ChatMap with linked devices.

## How to use it?

Create a group and ask people to post locations and messages. Each location will be paired 
with the closest message from the same user.

1. Export a WhatsApp, Telegram or Signal chat with shared locations
2. Upload a .zip file to this page
3. It will extract all the locations and display them on a map, together with the paired message (text or media)
4. You can also download the locations + messages as a .zip file from there

Check docs for each instant messaging app [here](https://github.com/hotosm/chatmap/blob/master/docs/apps.md).

## How to save the map

Login into umap.hotosm.org, click "Upload" and upload the .zip !
