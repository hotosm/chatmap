## Install and run

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

Test with `yarn test`.

## How to use it?

Create a group and ask people to post locations and messages. Each location will be paired 
with the closest message from the same user.

1. Export a WhatsApp, Telegram or Signal chat with shared locations
2. Upload a .zip file to this page
3. It will extract all the locations and display them on a map, together with the paired message (text or media)
4. You can also download the locations + messages as a .zip file from there

Check docs for each instant messaging app [here](https://github.com/hotosm/chatmap/blob/master/docs/apps.md).

## How to save the map

Login into umap.hotosm.org, click "Upload" and upload the .zip !
